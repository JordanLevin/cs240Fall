tail call optimization is when you design your code in a way that the
compiler can optimize the code to use the same stack frame.

This is done when you dont do any extra operations in the recursive call
ex:
no tail call optimization here
return recurse(n-1) + 5
tail call optimization here
return recurse(n-1, accumulator)
